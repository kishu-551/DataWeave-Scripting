Think about the types required and use the commented functions to filter the movies array so that only movies with an odd name length make it through.

SCRIPT
%dw 2.0
output json

var movies : Array<String> = ["The Terminator", "Titanic", "Avatar"]

//fun isOddNum(n : Number) : Boolean = (n mod 2) == 1
fun isOddNum(s : String) : Boolean = (sizeOf(s) mod 2) == 1
---
filter(movies,(n,idx) -> isOddNum(n))

OUTPUT

[
  "Titanic"
]
