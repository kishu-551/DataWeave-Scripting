Pretend youâ€™re developing a flow, and at this point in the flow you have some data that you can use to determine if the application processed the request correctly. You need to output a human-readable message to the caller informing them that everything went as expected, or there was a failure.

If everything went well, the result will contain {"status": "ok"}, if not the result will contain {"status": "failed"}. For the sake of the exercise, this will be available in a result variable you can edit.

Output {"message": "Request successfully processed."} if the status is "ok", and output {"message": "Please try again later."} if the status is anything else. Your solution should be able to compensate for both result types.

Result:
{"status": "ok"}
Output:
{"message": "Request successfully processed."}

SCRIPT

%dw 2.0
output json
var result = {"status" : "ok"}
---
if(result.status == "ok"){"message" : "Request successfully processed."} else{"message" : "Please try again later."}

OUTPUT

{
  "message": "Request successfully processed."
}
