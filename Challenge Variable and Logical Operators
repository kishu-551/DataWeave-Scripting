The exercise below contains no input. Instead, a data structure for you to work with is stored in the data variable. Use that variable to create an Array that contains three items.

The first item should be an Array containing all of the values associated with any name key in the data variable.

The second item should contain the address found in the data variable.

And the third and final item should be true when the address is outside of California (CA) and false otherwise.

Output:
[
  [
    "Max the Mule",
    "Max’s house"
  ],
  "1234 Mule Street",
  false
]
